# Claim Success Predictor Form - Technical Updates

## Overview

The Claim Success Predictor form has been significantly enhanced to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly interface for motor insurance claim prediction. The form now captures all necessary data points for accurate ML model predictions while maintaining excellent user experience.

## Form Structure Evolution

### From 6 Steps to 7 Steps

**Previous Structure (6 Steps):**

1. Incident Details
2. Vehicle Information
3. Driver Details
4. Documentation
5. Description & Evidence
6. Results

**Updated Structure (7 Steps):**

1. Incident Details
2. Vehicle Information
3. Driver Details
4. Documentation & Evidence
5. Additional Information
6. Description & Review
7. Prediction Results

## Enhanced Data Collection

### New Fields Added

#### Vehicle Information (Step 2)

```tsx
// Enhanced vehicle data for ML model
vehicleDamage: string; // Damage severity assessment
driver_age: string; // Driver age (critical ML feature)
vehicle_age: string; // Vehicle age in years
engine_capacity: string; // Engine CC for risk assessment
market_value: string; // Vehicle market value
```

#### Documentation & Evidence (Step 4)

```tsx
// Improved evidence collection
policeReportFiledWithin24h: number; // Timing compliance
trafficViolation: number; // Traffic violation count
previousClaims: number; // Claims history (3 years)
```

### Complete Field Mapping

```tsx
interface FormData {
  // Incident Details (Step 1)
  incidentType: string;
  timeOfDay: string;
  roadConditions: string;
  weatherConditions: string;
  injuries: "yes" | "no";

  // Vehicle & Driver (Steps 2-3)
  driver_age: string;
  vehicle_age: string;
  engine_capacity: string;
  market_value: string;
  vehicleDamage: string;

  // Documentation (Step 4)
  thirdPartyVehicle: "yes" | "no";
  witnesses: "yes" | "no";
  policeReport: "yes" | "no";
  policeReportFiledWithin24h: number;
  trafficViolation: number;
  previousClaims: number;

  // Description (Step 6)
  incident_description: string;
}
```
